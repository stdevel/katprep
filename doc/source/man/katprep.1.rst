**katprep** — Python toolkit for automating system maintenance and
generating patch reports along with Foreman/Katello and Red Hat
Satellite 6.x

DESCRIPTION
===========

katprep is a toolkit for automating system maintenance tasks such as:

-  Preparing system maintenance (scheduling downtimes, creating VM
   snapshots)
-  Installing errata and non-erratum package upgrades
-  Showing status of maintenance progress
-  Checking monitoring and snapshot status
-  Reverting VM snapshots
-  Removing downtimes and snapshots
-  Generating maintenance reports (e.g. because of of ISO/IEC 27001:2005
   IT certifications)

For VM management, the **libvirt** and **pyVmomi** (VMware vSphere
Python API bindings) libraries are used, therefore at least the
following hypervisors are supported: - VMware vSphere, Workstation,
Player - VirtualBox - QEMU - KVM - XEN - Microsoft Hyper-V

Check-out the libvirt website (https://libvirt.org/drivers.html) for
additional drivers.

For managing monitoring, the following products are supported: -
Nagios/Icinga 1.x - Icinga2

When creating reports, the document converter Pandoc is used. This
enables exporting reports in various formats; this utility offers
pre-defined Markdown and HTML templates.

Virtualization URIs
-------------------

When using **libvirt** specify a valid connection URI, such as:

| qemu+ssh://root@pinkepank.giertz.loc/system
| xen:///system
| esx:///system
| vpx://vc01/cluster02/locaiton03/esxi04/?no_verify=1
| vbox:///system

See the libvirt documentation
(https://libvirt.org/guide/html/Application_Development_Guide-Connections-URI_Formats.html)
for more examples.

When using **pyvmomi**, specify a valid ESXi host or vCenter Server
hostname, such as:

| vcenter.localdomain.loc
| esxi.giertz.loc

Monitoring URLs:
----------------

When using **nagios** (*NagiosCGIClient*), specify the full Nagios or
Icinga 1.x URL - make sure **not** to include **/cgi-bin**. Examples:

| https://nagios.giertz.loc/nagios
| http://omd.pinkepank.loc/icinga

When using **icinga** (*IcingaAPIClient*), specify the full API URL
including the port - such as:

| https://bigbrother.giertz.loc:5665

Utilities
---------

The following utilities are part of the katprep framework:

-  **katprep_authconfig(1)** - Manages credentials for third-party
   systems triggered by katprep
-  **katprep_maintenance(1)** - Prepares, executes and verifies system
   maintenance tasks
-  **katprep_parameters(1)** - Bulk edits Puppet host parameters for
   managed hosts
-  **katprep_populate(1)** - Auto-discovers and updates monitoring and
   hypervisor information for managed systems
-  **katprep_report(1)** - Creates reports after system maintenance
-  **katprep_snapshot(1)** - Creates infrastructure status overview
   snapshots

Usage
-----

In order to automate system maintenance, you will need to represent your
system landscape in katprep as the toolkit needs to know *which* hosts
are *VMs* running on *which* hypervisor monitored by *which* monitoring
system (managing physical hosts is also possible). From a Foreman
perspective, these information are stored as Puppet host parameter - see
also **katprep_parameters(1)**. To omit the need of entering these
information manually, two tools can assist - see
**katprep_parameters(1)** and **katprep_populate(1)**.

After your infrastructure is known to katprep, it can create
infrastructure status reports using **katprep_snapshot(5)**. This
snapshot includes information about hosts and outstanding patches.
Before and after managing hosts, a report needs to be created in order
to be able to calculate the delta. System maintenance is triggered via
**katprep_maintenance(1)**. This utilities automates preparing,
executing, verifying and cleaning-up maintenance tasks.

After finishing maintenance, it is possible to create maintenance
reports by leveraging **katprep_report(1)**.

So, in summary - to automate patching your system landscape, execute the
following tools:

1. **katprep_snapshot(1)** to create an infrastructure snapshot
2. **katprep_maintenance(1)** to prepare, execute and clean-up
   maintenance
3. **katprep_snapshot(1)** to create another infrastructure snapshot
4. **katprep_report(1)** to create maintenance reports (optional)
